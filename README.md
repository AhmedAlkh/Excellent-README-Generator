  # Excellent README Generator

  ## Description
  This is a node.js app that will generate a README.md file for the user. In the terminal, the user is prompted to fill out information for different sections of the README file. When the user has gone through all of the prompts in the termial, a properly formatted README file will be generated which can then be used in a GitHub repository. The README file will include the project title along with sections for the project description, installation, usage, license, contributions, tests, and questions. There will also be a table of contents generated near the top of the README for easier navigation throughthe different sections.

  ## Table of contents
  * [License](#license)
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Contributions](#contributions)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [Questions](#questions)

  ## Tests
  All testing was done by myself (creator of the app) while writing the code. Testing was done to see what output the user receives through different input scenarios. Some prompts require input for the user to proceedwhile others can be left blank because they are left as optional. Examples of prompts requiring input include project name and description. Some optional ones are installation and usage sections. The license section only appears if a license is selected. If no license is selected than the license section won't appear in the README or in the table of contents.
